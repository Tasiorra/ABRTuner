Most video content providers are interested in providing good video delivery QoE for all users, not just on average. Central to user's QoE are Adaptive Bitrate Algorithms (ABR) which determine the video bitrate to download given the network throughput and player buffer etc. Today, state-of-the-art ABR algorithms like BOLA and MPC rely on parameters that are sensitive to network conditions, so may perform poorly for some users and/or videos. In this talk, I will discuss our proposed technique, called Oboe, to auto-tune these parameters to different network conditions. Oboe pre-computes, for a given ABR algorithm, the best possible parameters for different network conditions, then dynamically adapts the parameters at run-time for the current network conditions. Using testbed experiments, we show that Oboe significantly improves BOLA, MPC, and a commercially deployed ABR. Oboe also betters a recently proposed reinforcement learning based ABR, Pensieve, by 24% on average on a composite QoE metric, in part because of its ability to better specialize ABR behavior across different network states.
